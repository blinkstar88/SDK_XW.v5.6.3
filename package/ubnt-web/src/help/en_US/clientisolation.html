<h3>Client Isolation</h3>
<p>
Allows packets to be sent only from the
external network to the CPE and vice versa. If Client
Isolation is enabled, wireless stations connected to the
same AP will not be able to interconnect on both the Layer
2 (MAC) and Layer 3 (IP) levels. This also affects associated
stations and WDS peers as well.
