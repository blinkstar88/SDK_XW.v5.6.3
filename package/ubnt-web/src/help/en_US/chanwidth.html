<h3>Channel Spectrum Width</h3>
<p>
Channel Spectrum Width can be used to control the bandwidth consumed by your link. 
Using a higher bandwidth will increased throughput. 
Using a lower bandwidth will allow an increased number of channels to be used (including more non-overlapping channels). 
Lowering bandwidth may also provide more robust links over long distances.
