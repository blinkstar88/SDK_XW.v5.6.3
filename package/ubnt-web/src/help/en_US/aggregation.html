<h3>Aggregation</h3>
<p>
A part of the 802.11n standard that allows
sending multiple frames per single access to the medium
by combining frames together into one larger frame. It
creates the larger frame by combining smaller frames with
the same physical source, destination end points, and
traffic class (QoS) into one large frame with a common
MAC header.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Frames</b> Determines the number of frames combined in
the new larger frame.</li>
	<li><b>Bytes</b> Determines the size (in bytes) of the larger frame.</li>
	<li><b>Enable</b> Check the box to use the Aggregation option.</li>
</ul>
