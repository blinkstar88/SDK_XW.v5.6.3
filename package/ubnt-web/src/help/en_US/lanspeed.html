<h3>LAN0/1 Speed</h3>
<p>By default, the option is <b>Auto</b>. The device
automatically negotiates transmission parameters, such as
speed and duplex, with its counterpart. In this process, the
networked devices first share their capabilities and then
choose the fastest transmission mode they both support.
To manually specify the maximum transmission link speed
and duplex mode, select one of the following options:
<b>100 Mbps-Full, 100 Mbps-Half, 10 Mbps-Full,</b> or <b>10 Mbps-Half.</b> Gigabit devices may offer the 1000 Mbps options. If you are running
extra long Ethernet cables, a link speed of 10 Mbps could
help to achieve better stability.
Full-duplex mode allows communication in both
directions simultaneously. Half-duplex mode allows
communication in both directions, but not simultaneously
and only in one direction at a time.
