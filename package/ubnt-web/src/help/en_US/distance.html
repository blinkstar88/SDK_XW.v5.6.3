<h3>Distance</h3>
<p>
To specify the distance value in miles (or
kilometers), use the slider or manually enter the value.
The signal strength and throughput fall off with range.
Changing the distance value will change the ACK
(Acknowledgement) timeout value accordingly.</p>
<p><b>Auto Adjust</b> We recommend enabling the Auto Adjust
option. Every time the station receives a data frame, it
sends an ACK frame to the AP (if transmission errors are
absent). If the station does not receive an ACK frame
from the AP within the set timeout, then it re-sends the
frame. If too many data frames are re-sent (whether the
ACK timeout is too short or too long), then there is a poor
connection, and throughput performance drops.
The device has a new auto-acknowledgement
timeout algorithm, which dynamically optimizes the
frame acknowledgement timeout value without user
intervention. This critical feature is required for stabilizing
long-distance 802.11n outdoor links.
If two or more stations are located at considerably
different distances from the AP they are associated with,
the distance to the farthest station should be set on the
AP side.
