<h3>Multicast Enhancement</h3>
<p>If clients do not send IGMP
(Internet Group Management Protocol) messages, then
they are not registered as receivers of your multicast
traffic. Using IGMP snooping, the Multicast Enhancement
option isolates multicast traffic from unregistered
clients and allows the device to send multicast traffic to
registered clients using higher data rates. This lessens the
risk of traffic overload on PtMP links and increases the reliability of multicast traffic since packets are
transmitted again if the first tranmission fails. If clients do
not send IGMP messages but should receive multicast
traffic, then you may need to disable the Multicast
Enhancement option. By default this option is enabled.
