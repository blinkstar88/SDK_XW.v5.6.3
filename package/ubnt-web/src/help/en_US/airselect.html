<h3>airSelect</h3>
<p>airSelect is a
technology that avoids interference and increases
throughput. It dynamically changes the wireless channel
by periodically hopping to the least used channel in the
Frequency List (user-defined) within a designated time
interval (user-defined in milliseconds). airSelect
tracks interference levels on each channel used, hopping
more frequently to those with the least amount of
interference.

<p><p><b>Note:</b> DFS channels will not be available if <b>airSelect</b>
 and <b>DFS</b> are turned on or <b>DFS</b> is mandatory for selected country.</p>
