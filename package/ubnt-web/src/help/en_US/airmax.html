<h3>airMAX</h3>
<p>airMAX is Ubiquiti's proprietary Time Division Multiple
Access (TDMA) polling technology. airMAX improves
overall performance in Point-to-Point (PtP) and Point-to-
MultiPoint (PtMP) installations and noisy environments
because it reduces latency, increases throughput, and
offers better tolerance against interference. Because of its
advantages, airMAX also increases the maximum possible
number of users that can associate with an AP that uses
airMAX.</p>
<p>airMAX assigns time slots for each device communication
to avoid the "hidden node" problem, which occurs when
a node is visible from a wireless AP, but not from other
nodes communicating with the originating AP.</p>
<p>For compatibility, legacy or 802.11 a/b/g devices should use
legacy firmware with airMAX support (such as airOS firmware
v4.0). Legacy clients can only work as airMAX clients with
the M Series device acting as an airMAX AP.
