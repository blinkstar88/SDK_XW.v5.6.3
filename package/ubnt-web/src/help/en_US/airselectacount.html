<h3>Announce Count</h3>
<p>The number of times between hops the AP will
announce the next hop information (such as frequency)
to clients. For example, if the Hop Interval is set to
10000 ms, and the Announce Count is set to 10, every
1000 ms the AP will send an announcement with
upcoming hop information to the clients. The larger
the time period between the Announce Count and Hop
Interval, the higher the risk of timing drift (hops not
being synchronized), so we recommend that you keep
the Hop Interval set to every 100 ms (or the Announce
Count to 1/100th of the Hop Interval). The default value
is 30.</p>
