<h3>airMAX Priority</h3>
<p>It defines the number of time slots (or amount of airtime)
assigned to each client. By default the AP gives all active
clients the same amount of time. However, if the clients
are configured with different priorities, the AP will give
clients more or less time, depending on the priority.<br />
Note: airMAX Priority only functions when multiple clients have it enabled.
<p>airMAX Priority options include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>High 4 time slots (4:1 ratio)</li>
	<li>Medium 3 time slots (3:1 ratio)</li>
	<li>Low 2 time slots (2:1 ratio)</li>
	<li>None 1 time slot (Default setting for clients; 1:1 ratio)</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients with a higher priority have access to more of the
AP's airtime, providing higher possible throughput and
lower latency when sharing with other active clients.
For example, if there are 3 clients, 1 set to None, 1 set to
Medium, and 1 set to High, the None client will get 1 time
slot, the Medium client will get 3 time slots, and the High
client will get 4 time slots.
