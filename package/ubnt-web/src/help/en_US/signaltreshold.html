<h3>Thresholds, dBm</h3>
<p>The number of LEDs is device-specific,
and the default values vary depending on the number of
LEDs. The specified LED will light up
if the signal strength reaches the value set in the field.</p>
<p>For example, if the device has four LEDs and the signal
strength (on the Main tab) fluctuates around -63 dBm,
then the LED threshold values can be set to the following:
-70, -65, -62, and -60.
