<h3>airSync</h3>
<p>airSync synchronizes airMAX APs with a satellite reference timing signal. When enabled, airSync
eliminates receive (RX) errors due to co-location transmit
interference.</p>
<p>Note: To use airSync, all Stations must run airOS
v5.5 or higher; otherwise, they cannot connect to
any of the APs.</p>
